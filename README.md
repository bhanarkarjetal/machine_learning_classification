# Machine Learning Classification Projects

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Classification** repository! This repository showcases various supervised machine learning classification projects that I have worked on. Each project involves real-world datasets, different classification algorithms, and detailed evaluations.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- **`project_name/`**: Each classification project is stored in its own folder.
  - `data/`: Contains the dataset(s) used in the project.
  - `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with detailed data analysis, preprocessing, and modeling steps.
  - `results/`: Contains metrics, plots, and summaries of the project.
  - `README.md`: Project-specific documentation.

## Key Features

1. **Diverse Classification Projects**:
   - Binary and multi-class classification problems.
   - Real-world datasets with varied complexity.

2. **Algorithms Used**:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - ROC-AUC Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Cross-Validation Scores

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical features (e.g., one-hot, label encoding).
   - Scaling and normalization of numerical features.
   - Feature selection and importance analysis.

5. **Handling Imbalanced Data**:
   - Techniques such as SMOTE, ADASYN, and undersampling/oversampling.
   - Stratified sampling for train-test splits.
